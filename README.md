_Giver a whirl! https://inatree.net/partypaint_

An experimental painting party messaround, written with my seven year old. Contribute a new brush in brushes.js, or just smash it directly into your PNG. Still in the "make a mess" stage of the Make A Mess Then Clean It Up school of software development, so lots of things may change.
